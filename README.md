## Unsolved Problems

During development, I encountered challenges with routing, especially due to the desire for a unique website style. This complexity slowed down the project. I realized that a more straightforward approach may have been better.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I'm going to aim to improve the website's layout, potentially incorporating parallax scrolling and other advanced features as my understanding of web development deepens.
